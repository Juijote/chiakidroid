Official repo: https://git.sr.ht/~thestr4ng3r/chiaki
The official Android app is actually not complete and contain some bug like the overlay that seem to be impossible to call cause wrong implementation.

So, here the things done on the android app:

* Touchpad Controller now fully worked
* Disable/Enable on-screen touch commands (Find it on option window)
* Diasable/Enable touchscreen in fullscreen (Useful if you are on docking like Kishi V2, also find it on option window)

Builded with Android Studio on WSL2 (Kali-distro)
